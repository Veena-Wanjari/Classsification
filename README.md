# Classification and Their Types

__What Is Classification?__

Classification is the process of recognizing, understanding, and grouping ideas and objects into preset categories or “sub-populations.” Using pre-categorized training datasets, machine learning programs use a variety of algorithms to classify future datasets into categories.

Classification is the process of predicting the class of given data points. Classes are sometimes called as targets/ labels or categories. Classification algorithms in machine learning use input training data to predict the likelihood that subsequent data will fall into one of the predetermined categories.

__Various types of classification algorithms:__

1) K Nearest Neighbour
2) Logistic regression
3) Naive Bayes Classifcation
4) Random Forest Classification
5) Decision Tree Classification
